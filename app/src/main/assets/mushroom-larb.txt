INGREDIENTS
¼ cup roasted, skinless peanuts
4 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
12 oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, quartered
3 scallions, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
1 1" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated
Kosher salt
1 medium shallot, thinly sliced into rings, rinsed, drained
1 red chile, such as Holland, Fresno, or Thai, thinly sliced
1 cup mint leaves, torn if large
1 Tbsp. fish sauce
¼ head of green cabbage, halved crosswise, leaves separated
Lime wedges (for serving)

RECIPE PREPARATION
Coarsely chop or crush peanuts into small pieces; set aside.

Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until bottom sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, about 4 minutes more. Add scallions, garlic, and ginger, followed by remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, and cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; season lightly with salt. Mix in shallot, chile, mint, fish sauce, and half of peanuts. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Transfer larb to a large bowl. Serve with cabbage, lime wedges, and remaining peanuts alongside.
